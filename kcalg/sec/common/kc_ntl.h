 Some other types
 In addition to the above, other generic vectors are declared, not explicitly documented elsewhere:
 
 vec_GF2XVec
 vec_ZZVec
 vec_double
 vec_long
 vec_quad_float
 vec_ulong
 vec_vec_GF2
 vec_vec_GF2E
 vec_vec_RR
 vec_vec_ZZ
 vec_vec_ZZ_p
 vec_vec_ZZ_pE
 vec_vec_long
 vec_vec_lzz_p
 vec_vec_lzz_pE
 vec_vec_ulong
 vec_xdouble
 These decalarations are found in ".h" files with corresponding names. These header files simply provide typedefs for the corresponding template types, mainly for backward compatibility, e.g., vec_double is a typedef for Vec<double>, and vec_vec_RR is a typedef for Vec< Vec<RR> >. No additional functionality is provided.
 
 All of the header files for polynomial classes ZZ_pX, ZZX, etc., declare typedefs for the corresponding vectors of polynomials vec_ZZ_pX, vec_ZZX, etc.
 
 There are also a number of generic pair classes defined, not explicitly documented elsewhere:
 
 pair_GF2EX_long
 pair_GF2X_long
 pair_ZZX_long
 pair_ZZ_pEX_long
 pair_ZZ_pX_long
 pair_lzz_pEX_long
 pair_lzz_pX_long
 
    These decalarations are found in ".h" files with corresponding names. Again, these files mainly exist for backward compatibilty, and provide typedefs for the corresponding template types, e.g., pair_GF2EX_long is a typedef for Pair<GF2EX,long>. These files also give typedefs for the corresponding vector types, e.g., vec_pair_GF2EX_long is a typedef for Vec< Pair<GF2EX,long> >. No additional functionality is provided.
